This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Azure AI Vision, Face, Custom Vision, and utilizing Generative AI for image processing. You will learn how to create and manage resources, explore various studios, and utilize SDKs for image and video analysis. Through hands-on challenges, you'll process images, perform face analysis, build custom classifiers and object detectors, generate and analyze images, and create image embeddings using Python. By the end of the course, you'll have a solid understanding of these powerful AI tools and how to apply them to real-world scenarios.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.

Learning objectives:
1. Identify common use cases for image processing
2. Build image-processing applications using Azure Vision, Azure Face, Azure Custom Vision, Azure OpenAI and Azure Content Understanding
3. Use Custom Vision to create custom classifiers and custom object detectors
4. Generate and analyze images using Azure OpenAI
5. Create image embeddings using Azure Vision for Image Retrieval Systems
6. Get structured from images and videos using Azure AI Content Understanding
